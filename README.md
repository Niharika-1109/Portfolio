# Portfolio
s is a modern, responsive, single-page portfolio website designed to showcase my skills and projects as a tech enthusiast and developer. It was built from scratch using pure **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript** to demonstrate strong foundational frontend abilities.  ### Key Features: * **Dynamic UI:** A custom circular cursor, self-typing headline, and smooth fade-in-on-scroll animations. * **Interactive Sections:** An animated "Expertise" section with progress bars and project cards with links to live demos and source code. * **Modern Tech:** Built with the `Intersection Observer` API for performant scroll animations. * **Responsive Design:** Ensures a great user experience on all devices, from mobile phones to desktops.
